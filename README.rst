CyPhi is a Python library for computing integrated information (|phi|), and
the associated quantities and objects.


Usage, Examples, and API documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation for the latest release is available online `here
<https://pythonhosted.org/cyphi>`_.

Documentation for the latest development version is available `here
<https://wmayner.github.io/cyphi>`_.

It is also available within the Python interpreter with the ``help`` function.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the latest release:

.. code:: bash

    pip install cyphi

To install the latest development version:

.. code:: bash

    pip install "git+https://github.com/wmayner/cyphi@develop#egg=cyphi"


MongoDB
```````
CyPhi stores the results of |Phi| calculations as they're computed in order to
avoid expensive re-computation. These results can be stored locally on the
filesystem, or in a full-fledged database. 

To use the database-backed caching system, you must install `MongoDB
<http://www.mongodb.org/>`_. Please see their `installation guide
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/>`_ for instructions.

Once you have MongoDB installed, use ``mongod`` to start the MongoDB server.
Make sure the ``mongod`` configuration matches the CyPhi's database
configuration settings in ``cyphi_config.yml`` (see the `configuration section
<https://pythonhosted.org/cyphi/index.html#configuration>`_ of CyPhi's
documentation).

You can also check out MongoDB's `Getting Started guide
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/>`_ or the full
`manual <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/>`_.


Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help develop CyPhi, fork the project on GitHub and install the requirements
with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

Development workflow
````````````````````

``Gruntfile.js`` defines some tasks to help with development. These are run
with `Grunt.js <http:gruntjs.com>`_.

To get ``grunt``, first install `Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_. Then, within
the ``cyphi`` directory, run ``npm install`` to install the local ``npm``
dependencies, then run ``sudo npm install -g grunt grunt-cli`` to install the
``grunt`` command to your system. Now you should be able to run tasks with
``grunt``, *e.g.*

.. code:: bash

    grunt tests

which will run the unit tests every time you change the source code. Similarly,

.. code:: bash

    grunt docs

will rebuild the HTML documentation on every change.

At some point I'll try to use a Makefile instead, since many more people have
access to ``make``.

Developing on Linux
```````````````````````````

Make sure you install the Python 3 C headers before installing the
requirements:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-scipy python3-numpy
