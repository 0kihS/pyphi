PyPhi
=====

PyPhi is a Python library for computing integrated information.

To report issues, please use the issue tracker on the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi>`_. Bug reports and pull requests are
welcome.

.. important::
    Each version of PyPhi has its own documentationâ€”make sure you're looking
    at the documentation for the version you're using. You can switch
    documentation versions in the bottom-left corner.

    The ``stable`` version of the documentation corresponds to the most recent
    stable release of PyPhi; this is the version you have if you installed
    PyPhi with ``pip install pyphi``. The ``latest`` version corresponds to the
    most recent unreleased development version (which may have bugs).
